# Movies Review

This is a project for a full stack web system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and NodeJS.

The objective is to create a website with different movies, series, animes, etc. separated by genre.

The idea is to use one or more APIs to obtain data about movies and together have a database for system-specific information, such as users and their data.

User profiles and CRUD will be developed, which will be able to have personalized lists of movies and will be able to give ratings and comments about them.

A possible improvement in this project is to make comments and notes public or private and social interaction between the users.

## APIs

List of possible APIs to be used in this project:

- The Movie Database (TMDb): Movies and TV shows
- Open Movie Database (OMDb) API: Movies and TV shows
- AniList API: Animes, mangas and characters
- JustWatch API: Where to watch movies and TV shows
