# Movies Review

This is a project for a full stack web system using many tools.

The objective is to create a website with different movies, series, etc. where the users can login and make notes and lists about the shows.

The idea is to use The Movie DataBase API to obtain data about movies and together have a database for system-specific information, such as users and their own data.
